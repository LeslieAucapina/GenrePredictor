# GenrePredictor
This is an ongoing project and will be continuously updated. The dataset includes 11 columns with attributes such as title, genre, artist, year, views, features, lyrics, ID, and language. My project's objective is to predict a song's genre based on its lyrics. The columns that will be mostly used are the genre and lyrics as well as artist, and album. Due to my variables of genre and lyrics being qualitative, I plan to accomplish this goal by encoding my categorical data of genre to numbers depending on the types of genres already listed. I plan to use a supervised learning technique to predict the genre such as logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors. It would be beneficial to search for commonalities between songs lyrically and compare their genres therefore listeners can have a better understanding of their music taste and the data scientists can anticipate the audience or which genre listeners would appeal to certain songs.

The dataset used is from Kaggle and is from Genius Song Lyrics. The URL is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information
